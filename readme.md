## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a transparent and decentralized reward mechanism for developers contributing to open-source projects. This will ensure sustainability and foster innovation within the developer community.

## Key Features
- **Contribution Logging**: Enables the contract owner to log contributions for developers, ensuring accuracy and fairness.
- **Reward Distribution**: Automatically calculates and distributes rewards proportionally based on logged contributions.
- **Dynamic Reward Pool**: Supports addition of funds to the reward pool by sponsors or the contract owner.
- **Secure and Transparent**: Built on the Ethereum blockchain for immutability and trust.
- **Resettable Contributions**: Resets contributions after each reward distribution, simplifying further reward cycles.
